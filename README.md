## What is Emprest?
Emprest is my personal project made to study automated tests and the SOLID concept together. It is a basic banking system, with three different banks (for now), and some features that will be shown soon. 

### Why create Emprest?
Long story short, to show and to pratice. IÂ´m a student from the brazillian online school Alura, to reach my first job and in the future become a Teacher. To do that, I think the best way is always pratice, so this is why all these projects are in my public repository.
